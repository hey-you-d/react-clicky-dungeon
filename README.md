# Clicky Dungeon Prototype

Live Demo URL: https://prod.d23cd5qsc8ogkn.amplifyapp.com/

This is a Javascript project to demonstrate my knowledge in developing web apps with React.js.
The project utilises Redux library for state management, among other popular 3rd party libraries
in React.js Development ecosystem. This project was built as part of my 100-days personal coding challenge (which began on 17th Mar 2019) to learn a new web development stack, and to build something awesome with it. A complete list of utilised libraries can be found on the 
`credit` page by clicking the `CREDIT` button at the bottom left of the Live Demo page.   

The data is fetched through RESTful API endpoints from a microservice built with Lumen PHP framework.
The microservice is hosted in AWS beanstalk. Future improvement will include adding authorisation 
with JSON Web Token (JWT). 

This project will also serve as my personal `playground` to try new development patterns, tools and libraries such as state management with React Hooks & Context, GraphQL, using a CSS preprocessor, or even Inline Styling, etc. Future plans include porting this web app to be a mobile app with React Native, and building a Progressive Web App (PWA). 

Currently, this project utilises following frameworks, & libraries:
* React.js
* Redux State Management library
* Twitter Bootstrap grid system
* Formik form builder library
* Jest testing framework 
* Enzyme testing library
* ESLint - AirBnb config
* Lumen Microservice Framework (for the backend)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
