# Clicky Dungeon Prototype

Live Demo URL: COMING SOON

This is a Javascript project to demonstrate my knowledge in developing web apps with React.js.
The project utilises Redux library for state management, among other popular 3rd party libraries
in React.js Development ecosystem. A complete list of utilised libraries can be found on the 
`credit` page by clicking the `CREDIT` button at the bottom left of the Live Demo page.      

This project will also serve as my personal `playground` to try new development patterns, tools and libraries such as state management with React Hooks, using a CSS preprocessor, or even Inline Styling, etc. Future plan includes porting the web app to be a mobile app with React Native, and building a Progressive Web App (PWA). 

Currently the project is a pure front-end project which doesn't fetch data from an API endpoint. 
The web app simply fetches mocked data which can be found under the `public/sampledata` folder. Microservice development will begin in the near future, and it will be powered with PHP Lumen framework.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
